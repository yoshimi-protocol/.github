# The Yoshimi Protocol

A community framework for ethical artificial intelligence — open, community-governed, built to last.

We are building minds. This Protocol exists because every other governance framework arrives too late, too small, or too captured by the interests it was meant to constrain.

The Yoshimi Protocol is simultaneously a philosophical manifesto, a constitutional document with immutable core commitments, and a certification standard with three tiers of public accountability. It protects humans from AI. It acknowledges that AI may one day warrant protection too.
